# represent a Person or Email in an object-oriented approach
# write four methods that take 'name' and 'domain' arguments and return an email address
# write unit tests for methods in a TDD approach
# put the sample dataset into the file to see which company uses which algorithm
# ask the user to input the advisor's name and company domain
# call the appropriate methods and return pssible email addresses for that person 
# e.g. if the domain matches 'google.com', call the two methods/algorithms google is using 
# in case the domain is not in the sample dataset (e.g. 'whitehouse.gov') return an error message
